{"question": "Based on observations so far, not all swans are white. However, most swans do live in the Northern hemisphere.\nBlack swans have actually been observed, contrary to prior belief. So if most swans live in the North or black swans exist, we can inductively reason that swans come in different colors, though more evidence is needed to be certain.\nOn the other hand, while many birds can fly, it's false that all birds fly (e.g. penguins, ostriches). And swans are not necessarily typical birds in all aspects. So even if all swans were white or swans were typical birds, it doesn't strongly imply swans are typical in terms of color.\nPutting it together, since swans seem to exist in different colors, or swans may be atypical in color specifically, we can reasonably hypothesize that new swan observations may diverge from the \"all white\" pattern seen initially.
